<h1>Mini project 01: Fiscal Characteristics of Major US Public Transit System</h1>
<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Public transit systems plays an important role in providing the essential transportation service for millions of residents in the United States. It serves over millions of people on a daily basis. Other forms of transit system include buses, trains, and commuter trains. In this project, we are looking to analyze the fiscal characteristics of public transit systems to evaluate their financial performance.</p>
</section>
<section id="fiscal-characteristics" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fiscal-characteristics">Fiscal Characteristics:</h2>
<p>We are going to analyze public transit systems based on the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Operating expenses: costs to operate (fuel, maintenance, employee salaries, etc)</p></li>
<li><p>Fare revenue: money earned from passenger fares</p></li>
<li><p>Farebox recovery ratio: how much of the operating expense is covered by the fares revenue (total farewell revenue/total operating expense)</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="importance-of-fiscal-data-analysis" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="importance-of-fiscal-data-analysis">Importance of fiscal data analysis</h2>
<p>By analyzing the fiscal data of public transit system, we can understand their financial performance. This will allow federal and/or state government make effective strategic planning regarding service improvement, budget funding, and stability.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-source" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-source">Data source:</h2>
<p>We used data from the <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd">National Transit Database</a>. Data files required:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.transit.dot.gov/sites/fta.dot.gov/files/2024-04/2022%20Fare%20Revenue.xlsx">2022 Fare Revenue</a></li>
<li><a href="https://data.transportation.gov/api/views/dkxx-zjd6/rows.csv?date=20231102&amp;accessType=DOWNLOAD&amp;bom=true&amp;format=true">2022 Operating Expenses</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/sites/fta.dot.gov/files/2024-09/July%202024%20Complete%20Monthly%20Ridership%20%28with%20adjustments%20and%20estimates%29_240903.xlsx">Monthly ridership</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I created the table using the code provided in the assignment instructions. In this code, I renamed “UZA Name” to “metro_area” (Task 1). I also modified the “Mode” column (Task 2) so we can understand the context of each abbrevations. The interpretation of the codes can be found on the NTD website in the <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/national-transit-database-ntd-glossary">glossary</a> section. A sample of 1000 observations is shown below:</p>

<p>Analyzing monthly ridership data helps identify patterns in transit usage. This information can be used to optimize service schedules. For example, during peak months (summer vacations of holiday seasons), the transit system should consider increase the service frequency to avoid overcrowded train cars. The transit system could also possibly utilize the off-peak months for service adjustments.</p>
