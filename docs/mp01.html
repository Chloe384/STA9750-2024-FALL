<h1>Mini project #01: Fiscal Characteristics of Major US Public Transit System</h1>
<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Public transit systems plays an important role in providing the essential transportation service for millions of residents in the United States. It serves over millions of people on a daily basis. Other forms of transit system include buses, trains, and commuter trains. The public transit system plays such a big role in our daily lives, hence it is important to analysis its fiscal characteristics to evaluate their financial performance.</p>
</section>
<section id="fiscal-characteristics" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fiscal-characteristics">Fiscal Characteristics:</h2>
<p>We are going to analyze public transit systems based on the following: 1. Operating expenses: costs to operate (fuel, maintenance, employee salaries, etc) 2. Fare revenue: money earned from passenger fares 3. Farebox recovery ratio: how much of the operating expense is covered by the fares revenue (total farewell revenue/total operating expense)</p>
</section>

<p>Analyzing monthly ridership data helps identify patterns in transit usage. This information can be used to optimize service schedules. For example, during peak months (summer vacations of holiday seasons), the transit system should consider increase the service frequency to avoid overcrowded train cars. The transit system could also possibly utilize the off-peak months for service adjustments.</p>
