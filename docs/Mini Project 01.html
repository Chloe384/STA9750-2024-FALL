<h1>Fiscal Characteristics of Major US Public Transit System</h1>
<section id="introductionbackground" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introductionbackground">Introduction/background</h2>
<p>Public transit systems plays an important role in providing the essential transportation service for millions of residents in the United States. One of the most well known transit system is the MTA (Metropolitan Transportation Authority). It serves over millions of people on a daily basis. Other forms of transit system include buses, trains, and commuter trains. The public transit system plays such a big role in our daily lives, hence it is important to analysis its fiscal characteristics to evaluate their financial performance.</p>
</section>
<section id="fiscal-characteristics" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fiscal-characteristics">Fiscal Characteristics:</h2>
<p>We are going to analyze public transit systems based on the following: 1. Operating expenses: costs to operate (fuel, maintenance, employee salaries, etc) 2. Fare revenue: money earned from passenger fares 3. Farebox recovery ratio: how much of the operating expense is covered by the fares revenue (total farewell revenue/total operating expense)</p>

<section id="importance-of-fiscal-data-analysis" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="importance-of-fiscal-data-analysis">Importance of fiscal data analysis</h2>
<p>By analyzing the fiscal data of public transit system, we can understand their financial performance. This will allow federal and/or state government make effective strategic planning regarding service improvement, budget funding, and stability.</p>
