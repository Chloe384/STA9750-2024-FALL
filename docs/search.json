    "text": "Welcome!!\nHi everyone. My name is Chloe Yu.\nI am a recent graduate from the Zicklin School of Business at Baruch College a few months ago with a BBA in Finance. Currently, I am enrolled in Baruch College’s graduate program. I majored in MS in Business Analytics with a concentration in data analytics. In my free time, I like to listen to music. I also like to cook food. It helps me feel relaxed and gives me a little break from whatever I’m doing that day.\nI have no prior experience with coding and this is my first time taking a course that involves coding. I believe it will be tough for me to learn all the functions of software required for this course but I hope by the end of the semester, I learn the basics and fundamentals of R and RStudio.\nThank you for visiting my website!"
